## A Turtle Bot powered by ROS that completes a rectangle

The bot is designed to control a TurtleBot (or a similar robot in a ROS (Robot Operating System) environment) to move in a rectangular path. The program accomplishes this by controlling the robotâ€™s linear and angular velocities to make precise movements and rotations. Using ROS's geometry_msgs/Twist message type, it commands the robot to move straight for a given distance and then rotate at specific angles to create the four sides of a rectangle.
